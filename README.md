# War: The Card Game

A learning game project in Love2D with Lua. You can install Love with Homebrew:

```
brew install --cask love
```

Or directly by [downloading the binary from love2d.org](https://love2d.org/#download). Homebrew initializes everything automatically, but if you would like to set up manually, refer to the [getting started guide](https://www.love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started).

Once installed, simply go to the base of this repo and run:

```
love .
```

Enjoy!
